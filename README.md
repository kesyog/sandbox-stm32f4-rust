# Nucleo-F401RE Rust sandbox

A sandbox with some basic examples created to help wrap my head around what using Rust for embedded
development looks like and keep a running list of helpful resources.

There's only a tiny bit new here beyond what's already in the linked embedded tutorials or the
examples available in the linked crates, but maybe the links down below are useful to someone ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ

## Hardware

I'm using an STM32 Nucleo-64 dev board I had laying around that's based around an STM32F401RE. Some
specs:

* 84MHz ARM Cortex M4 with floating point instructions
* 512K Flash, 96K SRAM
* Built-in ST-LINK debugger/programmer
* An LED and a button
* Lots of exposed pins

Let's push this board to the edge by blinking some LEDs üî•

## Plans

Check out the examples folder for some ugly implementations.

* [x] Follow the Rust embedded discovery [book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/index.html)
  * [x] blinky
  * [x] Hello world via ITM
  * [x] UART echo server
  * [x] blinky with hardware timer-based busy-waits
* [x] blinky using timer interrupts
* [x] UART echo server using interrupts
* [x] RTIC-based UART echo server
* [x] Draw some things on an SH1106 OLED display with the [embedded\_graphics](https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics)
  crate and the [sh1106](https://github.com/jamwaffles/sh1106) driver crate.
* [ ] Figure out DMA
* [ ] ???
* [ ] üöÄ
