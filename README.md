# Nucleo-F401RE Rust sandbox

A sandbox with some super basic examples created to help wrap my head around what using Rust for
embedded development looks like.

There's virtually nothing new here beyond what's already in the linked embedded tutorials or the
examples available in the various STM32 peripheral access and HAL crates, but maybe the links below
are useful to someone ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ

## Hardware

I'm using an STM32 Nucleo-64 dev board I had laying around that's based around an STM32F401RE. Some
specs:

* 84MHz ARM Cortex M4 with floating point instructions
* 512K Flash, 96K SRAM
* Built-in ST-LINK debugger/programmer
* An LED and a button
* Lots of exposed pins

Let's push this board to the edge by blinking some LEDs üî•

## Plans

Check out the examples folder for some ugly implementations.

* [x] Follow the Rust embedded discovery [book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/index.html)
  * [x] blinky
  * [x] Hello world via ITM
  * [x] UART echo server
  * [x] blinky with hardware timer-based busy-waits
* [x] blinky using timer interrupts
* [x] UART echo server using interrupts
* [ ] Port to RTIC
* [ ] Use DMA
* [ ] Move on to the STM32F7 Discovery boards I have laying around and drive their touchscreen
  displays
* [ ] ???
* [ ] üöÄ
